## Create a usefull makefile
### the compiler to be used
CC = gcc

### the .c files
SRC = main.c school.c

### the .o files file names
OBJ = ${SRC: .c = .o}

### the name of the executable
NAME = school

### the program to delete files
RM = rm -f

### your favorite compiler flags: 
CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic

## is the target that compiles our executable
### builds your executable
all: $(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME)

### deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
clean:
	$(RM) *~ $(NAME)

### deletes the object files
oclean:
	$(RM) $(OBJ)

### deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
